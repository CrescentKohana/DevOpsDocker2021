Skipped as skipping one non-mandatory exercise per part [is allowed](https://devopswithdocker.com/exercises/).

> To get a passing grade, you have to do every exercise, except you can skip one exercise for each part. You can not “save” skips between parts and skip two exercises in a later part. Some of the exercises are marked as mandatory, and they can not be skipped.
